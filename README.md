# 🛍️ Boost sales through Promotional Campaigns with Product Pair Analysis
Promotional gifts aren't as simple as they seem. Behind every gift lies a complex balance of inventory availability, suppliers' conditions, and the cost-to-gain ratio. To maximize the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, one of common approaches I propose is that using product pair analysis.

The core idea is simple:
> **When a customer buys Product A, they often also have the tendency to buy Product B.**

This recurring behavior creates **product pairs**. The more frequent the pattern, the stronger the pair's potential to drive cross-sales.

## 🎯 Applications

Businesses can use this analysis to:

- 🔍 **Highlight complementary products** visually on the product page
- 💬 **Trigger smart pop-up suggestions** or carousel recommendations
- 🎁 **Bundle products into combos** to boost average order value
- 💸 **Offer discounts** on Product B when Product A is purchased
